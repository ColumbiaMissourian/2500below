    <h1>Missouri bills database for 2000 to 2021</h1>

    <div class="desc">
      <p>This table contains bills truly agreed and finally passed during sessions from 2000 to 2021. The lists were compiled from the <a href="https://house.mo.gov/LegislationSP.aspx?focusedID=Bill%20List">Missouri House of Representatives past session archive</a> and contains bills from both the state house and senate. </p>
      <p>After downloaded from the house website, two columns were added including the general assembly and session. Columns names have been reorganized and edited for clarity.</p>
    </div>

    <p>How to use this table: Use the search bar to search for topics or words that would appear in the "Bill Long Title" column. The search bar is not case sensitive and can search multiple words or phrases. If you find an error, please let me know at ajennemann@mail.missouri.edu.</p>
